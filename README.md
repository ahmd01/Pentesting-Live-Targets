# -Project-8---Pentesting-Live-Targets

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

1) Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation
  * If you get the sessionID for another user, you will be able to log in using his/her sessionID
  * I used two different browsers with two different sessionIDs, and then copied one sessionID and paste it in the other browser.
  * By doing that I was able to log in to the blue website without typing any username or password.

2) Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)
  * If you go to salespeople page, you can find that the id= paramater is vulnerable to SQL injection.

2) Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
     * when you try to log in, if the username existed, you'll get a bold text; otherwise, you get a regular text for unsuccessful login
     
     * ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24450230/55092825-43cca880-5081-11e9-9d18-851dce92ea03.gif)
