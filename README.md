# -Project-8---Pentesting-Live-Targets

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

1) Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation
     * If you get the sessionID for another user, you will be able to log in using his/her sessionID
     * I used two different browsers with two different sessionIDs, and then copied one sessionID and paste it in the other browser.
     * By doing that I was able to log in to the blue website without typing any username or password.

2) Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)
     * If you go to salespeople page, you can find that the id= paramater is vulnerable to SQL injection.

## Green

1) Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
     * You can inject comments in feedback with XSS
     *Ex script: <a title="This Will Hack You!" onmouseover="alert('I Told You')" rel="" rel"nofollow"> THIS WILL HACK YOU! </a>

2) Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
     * when you try to log in, if the username existed, you'll get a bold text; otherwise, you get a regular text for unsuccessful login
     
     * ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24450230/55092825-43cca880-5081-11e9-9d18-851dce92ea03.gif)



## Red

1) Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
     * by changing the id number, you can view information you're not supposed to view! 
     
     * ![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24450230/55096001-184cbc80-5087-11e9-8ab2-161192a51fb5.gif)
     


2) Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
     * By creating a form and tricking the admin (victim) to open it, you can change any value or information. 
     
     * ![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24450230/55098789-85af1c00-508c-11e9-8f9f-7adc353b1471.gif)
